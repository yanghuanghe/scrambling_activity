Readme on using the MatLab code to analyze phospholipid scrambling rate

Introduction

This Readme file gives detailed instruction on how to use our customized Matlab code to quantify phospholipid scrambling rate based on the images we acquired. One example is included for demonstration purpose*. 

Content
1.	System requirements: MatLab, version R2015b. Operating system: Windows 7 or Mac. 
2.	Installation guide:
a.	Copy and paste the MatLab code to the folder, which contains the images to be analyzed. 
b.	Double click to execute MatLab.
c.	Click Run
d.	Manually draw the outline of a cell of interest based on the fluorescence signal on cell surface at 10 minute (the last image).
e.	The time-course of the fluorescence signal will be automatically plotted and corresponding t1/2 value will be shown in a separate window. 
3.	Demo data is included in this zip file. 
4.	Detailed step-by-step introduction (with snapshots) on using the code is included in a separate pdf file. The expected outcome is also included. 

Note: files 10000 to 10010 are examples for demenstration purpose.
